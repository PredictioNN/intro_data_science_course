    "\n",
    "The simplest model form is linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between one or more predictors $X$ and expected value of the target $Y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't discuss all of the Gauss Markov assumptions of linear regression (but a good book on the subject will cover it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(Y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + ... + \\beta_n X_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "- $E(Y)$ is the target\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$ is an intercept parameter\n",
    "- $\\beta_1$, ..., $\\beta_n$ are slope parameters or *weights*\n",
    "- $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ are predictors\n",
    "- $n$ is the number of predictors, which is one in the simplest case\n",
    "\n",
    "When all predictors are zero, the target value is equal to $\\beta_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of a single predictor, the model is called *simple linear regression*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key to regression is to discover the best set of predictors that explains or predicts the target.**  \n",
    "As we add useful predictors, it is possible to minimize the error between the predicted values and the target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the intercept and weights are estimated from data (model fitting).  \n",
    "These parameter values are determined such that the errors between the predicted values and the target values are minimized.  \n",

    "## III. Being Thoughtful About Features\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be tempting, particularly in the age of automation, to include all features in the model, perhaps letting the algorithm arrive at the best set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some important things to think about when deciding features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The features should make intuitive sense. In practice, the data scientist might discuss the features with the line of business, the product manager, and other stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The features should not introduce bias into the model, or introduce ethical issues.**\n",
    "\n",
    "One needs to be careful around the use of demographic variables, as it can be easy to discriminate based on age, gender, race, and ethnicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of variables that would introduce bias, and therefore should be avoided in modeling, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age, race, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, color, national origin, religion\n",
    "- employment type, where some jobs are skewed toward one gender, such as nursing (this targets females)\n",
    "- an indicator if a person pressed 2 to hear a message in Spanish (this targets an ethnicity)\n",
    "- salary (this targets race/ethnicity)\n",
    "- the kind of cuisine served at a restaurant (this is more subtle, but can target race/ethnicity)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *salary* predictor, if one were predicting who might default on a mortgage, it would be better from an ethics viewpoint to use *debt/income* as a predictor."
